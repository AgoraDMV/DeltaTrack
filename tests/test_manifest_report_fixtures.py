"""Manifest-driven committee report fixture tests (issue #295).

These tests exercise the committee report reader against ALL manifested report fixtures,
not just the Senate validation jurisdictions. This ensures the parser handles House
report formatting (which renders account tables as images) and detects any
Senate/118th-specific assumptions.

House reports are not expected to yield usable amount data (tables are images), but
they must parse without error and produce a valid document structure. This is a
parser generalization gate, not an amount-validation gate.

Every exception here is read from the manifest, never hardcoded in this file. A skip
list in test code is invisible to the vendoring script and to a reader of the data, and
it silently excuses whatever gets added to it -- which is how two govinfo error pages
came to sit in tests/data/ under fixture names while the gate stayed green (#295
review). ``text_available = false`` is the single declaration, and it is checked in
BOTH directions below: an unavailable report must have no fixture, an available one
must have a real one.
